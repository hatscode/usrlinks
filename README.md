# USRLINKS - The Ultimate Username OSINT tool

USRLINKS is a Python reconnaissance tool that checks username availability across multiple social media platforms. Designed for security professionals and penetration testers, it features a hacker-themed interface with bold blue styling. The tool supports single username checks or bulk scanning from files, with optional Tor anonymity and CSV report generation.

Simply install with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `python usrlinks.py -u username` to scan platforms like GitHub, Twitter, Instagram, Reddit and more. USRLINKS provides clear visual feedback with colored status indicators (✓ Available/✗ Taken) and preserves results for further analysis. The lightweight tool requires only Python 3.5+ and common libraries like requests and colorama.
